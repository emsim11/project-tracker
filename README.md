## Description (Need to Complete)

This week's mini project challenged us to create a Project Tracker web application! The first task involved creating a "Welcome!" header that welcomes users to the application and displays the current time and date that is updated every second. The second task involved creating a card component that explains the instructions of how to use the app and a button to create a new project in the Project tracker. The third task was to create a form that appears when the Add Project button is clicked that prompts users to input the name of the project, the type of the project using a drop-down selection menu, and the date the project is due using a datepicker. The fourth and final task was to create a table to display each project's information based on what the user inputted in the New Project button's form.

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors. Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Visuals (Need to Complete)

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

This web application was created using VS Code. It utilizes Bootstrap, Google Fonts, jQuery, and Day.js third-party APIs.

No installation is required to use the web application via your browser! 

## Usage (Need to Complete)

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. Provide instructions and examples for use.
